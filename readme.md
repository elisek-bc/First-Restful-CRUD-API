# First CRUD API

## What?
This is an execution of a tutorial found [here](https://www.callicoder.com/node-js-express-mongodb-restful-crud-api-tutorial/) on making a Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

## Contributors
I, Elise, am the only contributor to this project.

## Timing
This exercise was done as an introduction to NodeJS and making your own API's. There's not really a deadline on it. It's part of my educational training at Becode. I worked on it on the 11th June 2019.

## How?
* MongoDB
* Express
* NodeJS
* Javascript

## Struggles
Getting things done in Postman seems difficult. I don't managed to make this work yet.
